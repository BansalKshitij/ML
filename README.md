Kshitij's ML work illustrations

This Repository Contains Some Python based use cases which I, Kshitij Bansal used for ML Practice and refer as and when needed.

I do not claim any copyright IP for these code snippets & datasets. 
Anyone and everyone is free to use this for educational/self learning purposes like I did.

The reason for using Dummy data/Sample codes is obvious: 

I, Kshitij Bansal cannot add any of the data/codes used in my Data Science work experience here. 

I have worked with Major Global BFSI Clients - Banks, Payment Technology companies & Insurers as part of my experience with a Big4 Consulting Firm. 

Hence, respect and adhere to my responsiblities of Data security & confidentiality for the same.
